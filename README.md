# Kaldi utility scripts for the Aalto speech group
You know how you only how to find things in your own kitchen?
Well it's like that with scripts, too. Just open the drawers and cabinets and have a look.

## But where did you put *that thing*?
I put kaldi-vanilla module things in coffee-supplies. This module should be like "just add water" for Kaldi on Triton. It's got that vanilla taste.

I put good scripts in cutlery, and rarely used things in the bottom drawer.
